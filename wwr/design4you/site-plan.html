        Do you have unconstrained ideas and nowhere to play? Do you often have cool 
        inspirations but feel that you canâ€™t meet someone who understands you?
        The so-called design means "conceive and plan, conceive is the purpose, 
        and plan is the process arrangement", which usually refers to creative 
        behavior and activities with goals and plans. I have seen many underappreciated 
        creators around me, unable to show their talents to the fullest. 
        The purpose of creating this platform is to help these people's works to be seen by more people.
